# Said — Personal Portfolio

This repository contains a simple static portfolio site for Said built with plain HTML, CSS and a small JavaScript file.

Project structure

- `index.html` — main page

You can open `index.html` directly in a browser for a quick preview. For a better local testing experience, serve the folder with a simple static server. Example using Python 3:

python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
